This is a test project to understand how it can work to:

- base64 encode a cert
- store in secure credentials as a key/value pair
- decode in scripted browser or api test monitor with atob module, which is included in the Synthetics runtime.
- practice ES6 and asynchronous Javascript programming

4HB time well spent.
